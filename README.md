# Surface-Ion-Trap
A code to simulate the trapping electric fields for a surface ion trap based on the gapless approximation. 
This is a new design for a surface trap developed by me at the Haeffner's group for ion trapping at UC Berkeley.
The code is a mathematica based one, It simulate two qubit traps mediated by a floating wire for quantum information transfer between the two ions, however the second trap is omitted from this code.
